NSDF-Catalog is a **lightweight indexing service** with minimal metadata that complements existing domain-specific and rich-metadata collections. 

NSDF-Catalog is part of the [National Science Data Fabric](https://nationalsciencedatafabric.org) (NSDF) initiative, funded by  the [National Science Fundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) (NSF).

NSDF-Catalog is designed to facilitate multiple related objectives within a flexible microservice to: (i) coordinate data movements and replication of data from origin repositories within the NSDF federation (ii) build an inventory of existing scientific data to inform the design of next-generation cyberinfrastructure; and (iii) provide a suite of tools for discovery of datasets for cross-disciplinary research. 

NSDF-Catalog **indexes scientific data** at a fine-granularity at the file or object level to inform data distribution strategies and to improve the experience for users from the consumer perspective, with the goal of allowing end-toend dataflow optimizations. Index Termsâ€”national science data fabric, scientific data, cloud, high performance computing


## Quickstart

The fastest way to get started is to use docker-compose:

    $ docker-compose up

This spawns various containerized microserves which together form a NSDF-compatible indexing service.
An graphical overview is documented in (./docs/figures/overview.drawio).

It should now be possible to access a web frontend at:

    http://localhost:80/

And a REST API at:

    http://localhost:80/api/v1


## Production Deployment

It is highly recommended to run NSDF-catalog instances through a domain name to allow for HTTPs.

 * (A domain to allow HTTPs via LetsEncrypt/Certbot)
 * A publically available IP
 * A machine (physical or virtual) to spawn multiple containers
